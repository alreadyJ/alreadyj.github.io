    <h1>Welcome to our Privacy Policy</h1>
    <h3>Your privacy is critically important to us.</h3>
    {{ site.site_name }} is located at: Anywhere<br />
    <address>{{ site.site_name }}<br /><br />010-0000-0000</address>

    <p>It is {{ site.site_name }}'s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while
      operating our
      website. This Privacy Policy applies to <a href="{{ site.url }}">{{ site.url }}</a>
      . We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting
      personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy
      ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and
      under
      what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to
      information
      we collect through the Website and does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our Website, set forth the general rules
      and
      policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our Website, you may be
      required to agree to additional terms and conditions.</p>

    <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
    <p>Like most website operators, {{ site.site_name }} collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort
      that web browsers
      and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date
      and
      time of each visitor request. {{ site.site_name }}'s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information
      is to better
      understand how {{ site.site_name }}'s visitors use its website. From time to time, {{ site.site_name }} may
      release
      non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of
      its
      website.</p>
    <p>{{ site.site_name }} also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP)
      addresses for
      logged in users and for users leaving comments on {{ site.url }} site. {{ site.site_name }} only discloses
      logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
      personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

    <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
    <p>Certain visitors to {{ site.site_name }}'s websites choose to interact with {{ site.site_name }} in ways that
      require {{ site.site_name }} to
      gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that {{ site.site_name }} gathers
      depends on the
      nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a site at {{ site.url }} to
      provide a username and email address.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over
      the
      Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to
      protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

    <h2>Advertisements</h2>
    <p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These
      cookies
      allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile
      information
      about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver
      targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of
      cookies by {{ site.site_name }} and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>


    <h2>Links To External Sites</h2>
    <p>Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link,
      you
      will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy and terms and
      conditions of every site you visit.</p>
    <p>We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third
      party sites, products or services.</p>



    <h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
    <p>{{ site.site_name }} may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. {{ site.site_name }}
      may display this
      information publicly or provide it to others. However, {{ site.site_name }} does not disclose your
      personally-identifying
      information.</p>


    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>To enrich and perfect your online experience, {{ site.site_name }} uses "Cookies", similar technologies and
      services provided
      by others to display personalized content, appropriate advertising and store your preferences on your computer.
    </p>
    <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser
      provides to the website each time the visitor returns. {{ site.site_name }} uses cookies to help
      {{ site.site_name }} identify and track

      time, and in Navy
      Apple's sole discretion. {{ site.site_name }} encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to
